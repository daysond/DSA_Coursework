## Simple sorts

  * which algorithm did you find easiest to understand?

    One of the most simplest algorithm that was quite easy to understand was **Selection Sort** this is because it was pretty straightforward , we had to find a minimum value and put it at the lowest index with each iteration , It wad very easy to understand

  * which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort?

    All of them have same complexities O(n^2) but here when we performed it by ourselves we got the following observations
    - Selection Sort =>3 min 30 secs

    - Bubble Sort =>3 min 8 secs
    
    - Insertion Sort => 1 min 40 secs

    **Insertion sort** was quite faster than the other 2 here.

## Merging Unsorted lists

  * how long did this take

    it took us 10 minutes and 45 seconds to merge the list

  * did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
    	* How many times?

    We made mistakes , we chose a number thinking that it was the smallest one and then found another one which was smaller than that ,This mistake occured around 7 times

## Merging Sorted lists

  * how long did this take

      it took us 2 minutes and 48 secs to merge the list

  * did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
    	* How many times?

    no mistake was made.

## Sorting larger data sets

| Team member   | Sorting time |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| Team member 1 |      6:07        |
| Team member 2 |      5:42        |
| Team member 3 |      6:21        |

What was fastest time?

  5:42

Describe the algorithm produced by the team member with fastest time.

  Merge sort was used. First, every pair of elements was sorted out. Then, we combine every 2 pairs, sorted out the 4 numbers and put them into groups of 4. Next, for every 2 groups, we sorted out the numbers and combine them into bigger groups of 8. Now we have 6 groups and each group contains 8 numbers in order. So, we merge the 3 groups at a time and 2 groups of 16 numbers sorted were produced. Lastly we repeated the same, merging the 2 groups and now we have a sorted list of numbers.

## Partitioning

- how long did it take to partition the data set?

    it took us 2 minutes and 45 seconds to partition the data set

## Sorting the small piles

- how long did it take for you to sort all of the little piles?

    it tool us 8 minutes to sort all the little piles

## Putting it together

- As a team discuss things that helped sort the papers... what was useful? what was fast to do? What was slow?

  using fingers to point at the smallest number for some sorting algorithms like selection sort.

- As a team come up with a description of how best to sort a set of numbers on paper.

  Divide the papers into groups, sort the smaller groups first, then combine the groups like what we did in **Merging Sorted lists** experiment. We can start from the smallest number of 2 numbers in each group, merge it into group of 4, 8, 16 ...

- Mix up all your numbers and have each member of the team perform the sort you did. How long did it take?
